# Adding Image Cropping Functionality to Django Image Upload

This guide outlines the process of integrating image cropping functionality when users upload images in a Django web application. We'll be using the popular library `django-image-cropping` to achieve this.

## Steps

**Step 1: Install Required Packages**

Install the necessary packages for image processing and cropping:

```bash
pip install Pillow django-image-cropping
```


---

## Step 2: Add 'image_cropping' to your INSTALLED_APPS

Open your `settings.py` file and add `'image_cropping'` to the `INSTALLED_APPS` list:

```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    # ...
    'image_cropping',
]
```

This step ensures that the `django-image-cropping` library is integrated into your project and available for use.

---

## Step 3: Model Configuration

Assuming you have a model named `Image` to store uploaded images, add the `ImageCropField` to your model for storing cropping information:

```python
from image_cropping import ImageCropField

class Image(models.Model):
    image = models.ImageField(upload_to='images/')
    cropping = ImageCropField(blank=True, manual_crop=True)
```
---

## Step 4: Admin Configuration

Configure cropping in the Django admin panel by creating an `ImageAdmin` class and registering it:

```python
from image_cropping import ImageCroppingMixin
from django.contrib import admin

class ImageAdmin(ImageCroppingMixin, admin.ModelAdmin):
    list_display = ('image',)

admin.site.register(Image, ImageAdmin)
```
---

## Step 5: Update Templates and Forms

In your image upload template, add the cropping functionality using the `cropping_thumbnail` template tag:

```html
{% extends 'base.html' %}

{% block content %}
    <form method="POST" enctype="multipart/form-data">
        {% csrf_token %}
        {{ form.as_p }}
        <input type="submit" value="Upload">
    </form>
    {% if object.image %}
        <img src="{{ object.image.url|cropping_thumbnail:"200x200" }}" alt="Cropped Image">
    {% endif %}
{% endblock %}
```

----

## Step 6: Handling Uploaded Images in Views

In your view that handles image uploads, save the cropping information along with the image:

```python
def upload_image(request):
    if request.method == 'POST':
        form = ImageForm(request.POST, request.FILES)
        if form.is_valid():
            instance = form.save()
            instance.cropping = (x, y, width, height)  # Set cropping values
            instance.save()
            return redirect('image_detail', pk=instance.pk)
    else:
        form = ImageForm()
    return render(request, 'upload_image.html', {'form': form})
```
----

## Step 7: Displaying Cropped Images

Use the `cropping_thumbnail` template tag to display cropped images in your templates. Adjust the size and cropping dimensions according to your needs.

And that's it! You've successfully integrated image cropping functionality into your Django image upload process using `django-image-cropping`. Customize the code to fit your project's structure and design preferences.
